## Challenge Description

Navigate the **guard patrol** in a 1518 North Pole lab by:

1. Tracking the guard's patrol path based on movement rules (Part 1).
2. Identifying positions where a single obstruction can trap the guard in a loop (Part 2).

The guard follows a strict patrol protocol:

-   **Turn Right** if an obstruction is ahead.
-   **Move Forward** if the path is clear.

---

### Example

**Part 1:**  
For a given map, predict all positions the guard will visit before leaving the area.  
Distinct positions visited: `41`.

**Part 2:**  
Add a single obstruction to trap the guard in a loop.  
Valid obstruction positions: `6`.

## Results (According to my data)

-   **Part 1 Distinct Positions Visited:** `4778`
-   **Part 2 Valid Obstruction Positions:** `1618`
